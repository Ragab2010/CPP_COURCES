          Alright — let’s go step-by-step and make an example for Conditional Breakpoints in GDB, with a real C program to test it, then I’ll explain the concept.

1. What is a Conditional Breakpoint?

A conditional breakpoint in GDB is a breakpoint that only stops your program when a certain condition is true.

Syntax:

break  if

Condition is an expression evaluated at runtime.
Useful for avoiding stopping every time the breakpoint is hit — it stops only when the condition is met.

2. Example C program

#include

void process(int value) {
    printf("Processing value: %d\n", value);
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i  7

Here:

1 is the breakpoint number from info breakpoints.
The condition is changed so it breaks when value > 7.

7. Useful Commands

info breakpoints → shows all breakpoints and their conditions.
condition   → set/change a condition.
condition  → remove the condition.

If you want, I can also give you an example combining conditional breakpoints with until, display, and x so you can see them working together in one debugging session.
That way, you’d see a "real debugging workflow" in action.
