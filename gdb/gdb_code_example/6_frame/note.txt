Alright — let’s go step-by-step on frames and stack frames in GDB, with a hands-on example that will let you see exactly what’s going on.

1. What is a "frame" in GDB?

In GDB terms, a frame is basically a snapshot of a function’s stack frame — the chunk of memory the function uses on the call stack while it’s running.

Each frame contains:

The function name
Its arguments and local variables
The return address (where execution will go back after the function finishes)
The saved registers and other housekeeping info

When a program calls functions, each call gets its own stack frame.
When you do a backtrace (bt), GDB shows all the frames currently in the call stack.

2. Example C program: frames_demo.c

#include

void level3(int x) {
    int l3_var = x * 10;
    printf("In level3, l3_var = %d\n", l3_var);
}

void level2(int b) {
    int l2_var = b + 5;
    level3(l2_var);
}

void level1(int a) {
    int l1_var = a - 2;
    level2(l1_var);
}

int main() {
    int main_var = 7;
    level1(main_var);
    return 0;
}

3. Compile with debug info

gcc -g -o frames_demo frames_demo.c

4. Run in GDB

gdb ./frames_demo

Set a breakpoint in level3:

(gdb) break level3
(gdb) run

When the breakpoint hits, the stack looks like:

A. Backtrace (all frames)

(gdb) backtrace
#0  level3 (x=10) at frames_demo.c:4
#1  0x000055555555515e in level2 (b=5) at frames_demo.c:9
#2  0x0000555555555174 in level1 (a=7) at frames_demo.c:14
#3  0x0000555555555189 in main () at frames_demo.c:19

#0** → Current frame (level3)
#1** → Who called it (level2)
#2** → Who called that (level1)
#3** → Main program start

B. Inspecting a specific frame

(gdb) frame 1

Moves to frame #1 (inside level2).
Now:

(gdb) info locals
l2_var = 5
(gdb) info args
b = 5

C. Moving up & down the call stack

(gdb) up     # go toward main
(gdb) down   # go toward current function

D. Full frame info

(gdb) info frame
Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffe4a0:
 rip = 0x555555555144 in level3 (frames_demo.c:4); saved rip = 0x55555555515e
 called by frame at 0x7fffffffe4c0
 source language c.
 Arglist at 0x7fffffffe490, args: x=10
 Locals at 0x7fffffffe490, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffe4a0
 Saved registers:
  rip at 0x7fffffffe498

rip → instruction pointer (x86-64)
Shows arguments, locals, and saved return address.

E. Why frames are important in debugging

Let you navigate the call stack when debugging complex crashes.
See exactly what arguments and locals each function had when called.
Crucial for analyzing segfaults and logic bugs that happen deep in the call chain.

If you want, I can make a segfault example where we use frames to walk up from the crash point and find the bad argument value in an earlier frame — that’s how frames are really useful in real debugging.
Do you want me to do that next?
