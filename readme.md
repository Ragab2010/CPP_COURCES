# Welcome to My C++ YouTube Channel!

Hello and welcome! This repository is the companion to my YouTube channel, where I dive deep into **C++ Semantics, Idioms, Templates, Exception Handling, Concurrency, and Debugging**. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced C++ developer, my videos are designed to help you master advanced C++ concepts, write efficient, modern code, and debug like a pro.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by topic, with source code for each video and playlist. Below are the main directories:

- **`semantics_idioms/`**: Code for C++ Semantics and Idioms videos (e.g., copy-and-swap, move semantics).
- **`templates/`**: Code for C++ Templates videos (e.g., variadic templates, type deduction).
- **`exceptions/`**: Code for C++ Exceptions videos (e.g., custom exceptions, `noexcept`).
- **`concurrency/`**: Code for C++ Concurrency videos (e.g., `std::counting_semaphore`, `std::latch`, `std::barrier`).
- **`gdb_debugging/`**: Code for Debugging with GDB videos (e.g., `factorial.c`, `segfault_demo.c`).

Each directory contains source code files and examples corresponding to specific videos, with detailed comments to help you follow along.
