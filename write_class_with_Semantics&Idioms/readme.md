## Zero initialization
Zero initialization is a way to initialize variables in C++ that sets primitive integer types (such as char, int, etc.) to zero, primitive floating-point types to 0.0, pointer types to `nullptr`, and constructs objects with the default constructor. 

**To perform zero initialization, you can use an empty set of curly braces `{}` as a uniform initializer**. This is also referred to as a **zero initializer**. 

Here are a few key points about zero initialization:

*   It's recommended to always initialize data members of a class. Zero initialization is a good way to ensure that your variables have a default value.
*   **If no initialization values are given to an array when it is created, the array elements will be uninitialized**, unlike other containers like `vector` and `list`, where elements are always initialized.
*   The `make_unique()` function uses value initialization, which initializes primitive types to zero. However, `make_unique_for_overwrite()`, introduced in C++20, can be used to create an array with default-initialized values, which means they are uninitialized for primitive types.
*   When using the zero-initialization syntax `T{}` in a class template member function, it calls the default constructor for the object if `T` is a class type and generates zero if `T` is a primitive type.

The term **default initialization** is distinct from zero initialization. Default initialization doesn't initialize primitive types, leaving them with whatever is in memory at their location, while objects are still default constructed.

Overall, zero initialization is a valuable technique in C++ for ensuring your variables have a predictable initial state, especially when working with primitive data types and pointers.

## Pass Argument to ( const std::string&  VS  Pass by std::string and move ownership)

When passing a **string literal** (e.g., `"Hello"`) to a constructor in C++, you have two common options for how to handle it:

1. **Pass by `const std::string&`**:
    - The constructor takes a `const std::string&` parameter.
    - The string literal is implicitly converted to a `std::string` temporary, and the reference binds to it.
    - The member variable is initialized by copying the temporary `std::string`.
2. **Pass by `std::string` and move ownership**:
    - The constructor takes a `std::string` parameter by value.
    - The string literal is implicitly converted to a `std::string` temporary.
    - The member variable is initialized by **moving** the temporary `std::string` (avoiding a copy).

Let’s break down the differences, performance implications, and which approach is better in various scenarios.

---

### **Option 1: Pass by `const std::string&`**

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(const std::string& str) : m_str(str) {} // Copy from the reference

    void print() const {
        std::cout << m_str << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string m_str;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj("Hello"); // String literal passed to constructor
    obj.print();
    return 0;
}

```

### Behavior:

1. The string literal `"Hello"` is implicitly converted to a temporary `std::string`.
2. The `const std::string&` parameter binds to this temporary.
3. The member variable `m_str` is initialized by **copying** the temporary `std::string`.

### Performance:

- **One allocation**: The temporary `std::string` allocates memory for the string data.
- **One copy**: The member variable `m_str` copies the data from the temporary.

---

### **Option 2: Pass by `std::string` and Move Ownership**

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(std::string str) : m_str(std::move(str)) {} // Move from the parameter

    void print() const {
        std::cout << m_str << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string m_str;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj("Hello"); // String literal passed to constructor
    obj.print();
    return 0;
}

```

### Behavior:

1. The string literal `"Hello"` is implicitly converted to a temporary `std::string`.
2. The temporary `std::string` is passed by value to the constructor.
3. The member variable `m_str` is initialized by **moving** the temporary `std::string`.

### Performance:

- **One allocation**: The temporary `std::string` allocates memory for the string data.
- **One move**: The member variable `m_str` takes ownership of the allocated memory from the temporary. Moving a `std::string` is typically cheap (just pointer swaps).

---

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect** | **Pass by `const std::string&`** | **Pass by `std::string` and Move** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Parameter Type** | `const std::string&` (reference to a `std::string`) | `std::string` (value) |
| **String Literal Handling** | Temporary `std::string` is created and copied | Temporary `std::string` is created and moved |
| **Performance** | One allocation + one copy | One allocation + one move |
| **Flexibility** | Works well for both lvalues and rvalues | Optimized for rvalues (e.g., temporaries) |
| **Code Complexity** | Simple | Requires `std::move` for optimal performance |

---

### **Which is Better?**

### **Pass by `std::string` and Move Ownership** is generally better for the following reasons:

1. **Performance**:
    - Moving a `std::string` is cheaper than copying it, especially for large strings.
    - Avoids unnecessary copies when passing temporaries (e.g., string literals).
2. **Flexibility**:
    - Works efficiently with both lvalues and rvalues.
    - If an lvalue is passed, it will be copied into the parameter, and then moved into the member variable.
    - If an rvalue (e.g., a temporary or the result of `std::move`) is passed, it will be moved directly.
3. **Modern C++ Best Practices**:
    - Moving resources is a key feature of modern C++ (since C++11) and should be used to optimize performance.

### **Pass by `const std::string&`** is still useful in some cases:

- When you want to avoid modifying the input string.
- When you don’t need to store the string in the class (e.g., if you’re only reading from it).

---

### **Example with Both Lvalues and Rvalues**

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(std::string str) : m_str(std::move(str)) {} // Move from the parameter

    void print() const {
        std::cout << m_str << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string m_str;
};

int main() {
    std::string lvalue = "Hello from lvalue";
    MyClass obj1(lvalue); // Lvalue: copied then moved
    obj1.print();

    MyClass obj2("Hello from rvalue"); // Rvalue: moved directly
    obj2.print();

    return 0;
}

```

### Behavior:

- For `obj1`, the lvalue `lvalue` is copied into the constructor parameter, then moved into `m_str`.
- For `obj2`, the rvalue `"Hello from rvalue"` is moved directly into `m_str`.

---


## **Why Are Move Semantics Created as `noexcept`?**

Move semantics are often marked as `noexcept` for the following reasons:

1. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Many standard library containers (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::string`) use move semantics internally to optimize performance.
    - If a move constructor or move assignment operator is `noexcept`, these containers can safely use it during reallocation or resizing. If not, they may fall back to copying, which is slower.
2. **Exception Safety**:
    - Move operations are expected to be "no-fail" because they simply transfer ownership of resources (e.g., pointers, file handles) without allocating new resources.
    - If a move operation were to throw an exception, it could leave the program in an inconsistent state (e.g., partially moved objects).
3. **Guaranteed Behavior**:
    - Marking move operations as `noexcept` ensures that they will not throw exceptions, making them predictable and reliable.

---


### **What Happens If an Exception Triggers in a `noexcept` Function?**

If an exception is thrown inside a function marked as `noexcept`, the program will call `std::terminate()`, which terminates the program abruptly. This is because `noexcept` is a promise that the function will not throw exceptions, and violating this promise is considered a serious error.

--- 
### Copy Assignment Operator

The **copy-and-swap idiom** creates a temporary copy of the right-hand side (rhs) object within the assignment operator, then performs all necessary operations (like memory allocation or resource acquisition) on this temporary copy. Finally, if all operations succeed, it swaps the contents of the temporary object with the left-hand side (lhs) object using a non-throwing `swap` function. This guarantees that:

- **If an exception occurs during the creation of the temporary copy or any subsequent operations on the copy, the original lhs object remains untouched.** The exception will propagate out of the assignment operator, leaving the lhs object in its original state.
- **If all operations succeed, the swap operation is guaranteed to be non-throwing**, ensuring a clean transfer of ownership and resources from the temporary object to the lhs object.

**Example (from the sources):**

```cpp
Spreadsheet& Spreadsheet::operator=(const Spreadsheet& rhs) {
    Spreadsheet temp { rhs }; // Create temporary copy of rhs
    swap(temp);               // Swap contents of temp with *this
    return *this;
}

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`Spreadsheet temp { rhs };`**: A temporary `Spreadsheet` object, `temp`, is created using the copy constructor, initializing it with the contents of `rhs`. This is the potential exception-prone phase, as copying data or allocating resources might fail.
2. **`swap(temp);`**: If the creation of `temp` and any other operations within `temp` succeed, the `swap` function is called to exchange the contents of `temp` with the current object (`this`). The `swap` function is typically implemented to be non-throwing, ensuring a safe and atomic transfer of data.
3. **`return *this;`**: Finally, a reference to the updated object (`this`) is returned.

---


## Move Assignment Operator & Copy Assignment Operator

### Move Assignment Operator

The **move-and-swap idiom** is similar to the copy-and-swap idiom but is specifically designed for move assignment operators. It involves moving the rhs object into a temporary object, then swapping the contents of the temporary object with the lhs object.

The sources provide two ways to implement the move assignment operator:

**1. Using a helper function `moveFrom()`:**

```cpp
Spreadsheet& Spreadsheet::operator=(Spreadsheet&& rhs) noexcept {
    // Check for self- assignment
    if (this == &rhs) {
        return *this;
    }

    // Free the old memory and move ownership
    cleanup();
    moveFrom(rhs);
    return *this;
}

void Spreadsheet::moveFrom(Spreadsheet& src) noexcept {
    // Shallow copy of data
    m_width = src.m_width;
    m_height = src.m_height;
    m_cells = src.m_cells;

    // Reset the source object, because ownership has been moved!
    src.m_width = 0;
    src.m_height = 0;
    src.m_cells = nullptr;
}

```

**2. Implementing directly in terms of the `swap` function:**

```cpp
Spreadsheet& Spreadsheet::operator=(Spreadsheet&& rhs) noexcept {
    auto moved { std::move(rhs) }; // Move rhs into moved (noexcept)
    swap(moved); // Commit the work with only non- throwing operations
    return *this;
}

//Alternative implementation

Spreadsheet& Spreadsheet::operator=(Spreadsheet&& rhs) noexcept {
    swap(rhs);
    return *this;
}

```

**Explanation:**

- The first implementation moves the data from `rhs` using the helper function `moveFrom` after cleaning up the old memory of the lhs object.
- The second implementation directly uses the `swap` function to exchange the contents of the temporary object `moved` with the current object, making it more concise.

**Benefits of These Idioms:**

- **Strong Exception Safety:** The state of the lhs object remains unchanged if an exception occurs.
- **Code Conciseness and Clarity:** They provide a standardized, clear, and relatively concise way to implement assignment operators with exception safety.
- **Reduced Code Duplication:** Using the `swap` function can minimize code duplication, as it can be reused for both copy and move assignment.

These idioms are generally considered best practices for implementing assignment operators for classes that manage resources, ensuring that your code is robust and handles potential errors gracefully.
---

## copy assignment operator, move assignment operator, and the unified assignment operator
---

### **1. Copy Assignment Operator**
The **copy assignment operator** is used to copy the contents of one object to another. It typically performs a **deep copy** of the resources owned by the object.

#### **Syntax:**
```cpp
MyVector& operator=(const MyVector& other);
```

#### **Key Characteristics:**
- Takes a `const` reference to the source object (`other`).
- Performs a deep copy of the resources.
- Must handle self-assignment (e.g., `v1 = v1`).

#### **Example:**
```cpp
MyVector& operator=(const MyVector& other) {
    if (this != &other) { // Check for self-assignment
        delete[] data; // Free existing resource
        data = new int[other.size]; // Allocate new memory
        size = other.size;
        std::copy(other.data, other.data + size, data); // Copy data
    }
    return *this;
}
```

---

### **2. Move Assignment Operator**
The **move assignment operator** is used to transfer ownership of resources from one object to another. It is typically used with **rvalue references** (`&&`) and avoids expensive deep copies.

#### **Syntax:**
```cpp
MyVector& operator=(MyVector&& other) noexcept;
```

#### **Key Characteristics:**
- Takes an rvalue reference to the source object (`other`).
- Transfers ownership of resources from `other` to `*this`.
- Leaves `other` in a valid but unspecified state (usually `nullptr` or equivalent).
- Should be marked `noexcept` to indicate it does not throw exceptions.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
MyVector& operator=(MyVector&& other) noexcept {
    if (this != &other) { // Check for self-assignment
        delete[] data; // Free existing resource
        data = other.data; // Steal the resource
        size = other.size;
        other.data = nullptr; // Leave 'other' in a valid state
        other.size = 0;
    }
    return *this;
}
```

---

### **3. Unified Assignment Operator (Copy-and-Swap Idiom)**
The **unified assignment operator** combines both copy and move semantics using the **copy-and-swap idiom**. It takes the source object **by value**, which allows the compiler to automatically choose between the copy constructor and move constructor depending on whether the argument is an lvalue or rvalue.

#### **Syntax:**
```cpp
MyVector& operator=(MyVector other);
```

#### **Key Characteristics:**
- Takes the source object **by value** (`other`).
- Uses the **swap** function to exchange resources between `*this` and `other`.
- Automatically handles both copy and move semantics.
- Simplifies code by reusing the copy constructor and move constructor.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
MyVector& operator=(MyVector other) {
    std::cout << "Copy-and-Swap Assignment Operator called\n";
    swap(*this, other); // Swap resources
    return *this;
}
```

#### **How It Works:**
1. When the assignment operator is called:
   - If `other` is an **lvalue**, the **copy constructor** is invoked to create a copy of `other`.
   - If `other` is an **rvalue**, the **move constructor** is invoked to transfer resources from `other`.
2. The `swap` function exchanges the resources of `*this` and `other`.
3. When `other` goes out of scope, its destructor cleans up the old resources of `*this`.

---

### **Comparison of the Three Approaches**

| **Feature**                     | **Copy Assignment Operator** | **Move Assignment Operator** | **Unified Assignment Operator (Copy-and-Swap)** |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Parameter Type**              | `const MyVector&`            | `MyVector&&`                 | `MyVector` (by value)                           |
| **Handles Copy Semantics**      | Yes                          | No                           | Yes                                             |
| **Handles Move Semantics**      | No                           | Yes                          | Yes                                             |
| **Self-Assignment Handling**    | Explicit (`if (this != &other)`) | Explicit (`if (this != &other)`) | Implicit (handled by swap)                      |
| **Code Duplication**            | High (separate implementation) | High (separate implementation) | Low (reuses copy/move constructor)              |
| **Performance**                 | Good                         | Excellent (avoids deep copy)  | Good (may involve an extra move)                |
| **Complexity**                  | Moderate                     | Moderate                      | Low                                             |

### **Advantages of the Unified Assignment Operator (Copy-and-Swap)**
1. **Simplifies Code**:
   - Combines copy and move semantics into a single function.
   - Reuses the copy constructor and move constructor.

2. **Exception Safety**:
   - The swap operation is typically `noexcept`, making the assignment operator exception-safe.

3. **Self-Assignment Handling**:
   - Self-assignment is automatically handled by the swap function.

4. **DRY Principle**:
   - Avoids code duplication by reusing existing constructors.

---

### **Disadvantages of the Unified Assignment Operator (Copy-and-Swap)**
1. **Performance Overhead**:
   - Involves an extra move operation when the argument is an rvalue.
   - May not be as efficient as a dedicated move assignment operator in some cases.

2. **Less Explicit**:
   - The behavior is less explicit compared to separate copy and move assignment operators.

---

### **When to Use Each Approach**
1. **Copy Assignment Operator**:
   - Use when you only need to handle copy semantics (pre-C++11 code).

2. **Move Assignment Operator**:
   - Use when you want to optimize for move semantics (C++11 and later).

3. **Unified Assignment Operator (Copy-and-Swap)**:
   - Use when you want a simple, exception-safe, and unified implementation that handles both copy and move semantics.

---

### **Example: Unified Assignment Operator in Action**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for std::swap

class MyVector {
private:
    int* data;
    size_t size;
public:
    // Constructor
    MyVector(size_t size = 0) : data(new int[size]), size(size) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called\n";
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyVector() {
        delete[] data;
        std::cout << "Destructor called\n";
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    MyVector(const MyVector& other) : data(new int[other.size]), size(other.size) {
        std::copy(other.data, other.data + size, data);
        std::cout << "Copy Constructor called\n";
    }

    // Move Constructor
    MyVector(MyVector&& other) noexcept : data(other.data), size(other.size) {
        other.data = nullptr;
        other.size = 0;
        std::cout << "Move Constructor called\n";
    }

    // Unified Assignment Operator (Copy-and-Swap)
    MyVector& operator=(MyVector other) {
        std::cout << "Copy-and-Swap Assignment Operator called\n";
        swap(*this, other);
        return *this;
    }

    // Swap Function
    friend void swap(MyVector& first, MyVector& second) noexcept {
        std::swap(first.data, second.data);
        std::swap(first.size, second.size);
    }

    // Helper function to print size
    void printSize() const {
        std::cout << "Size: " << size << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    MyVector v1(5);
    MyVector v2(10);

    v1 = v2; // Copy assignment (lvalue)
    v1.printSize();

    v1 = MyVector(15); // Move assignment (rvalue)
    v1.printSize();

    return 0;

## **NRVO (Named Return Value Optimization)** and **RVO (Return Value Optimization)** 
---

### **What Are RVO and NRVO?**
1. **RVO (Return Value Optimization)**:
   - The compiler eliminates the temporary object created to hold the return value of a function.
   - Instead, the compiler constructs the return value directly in the memory location where the caller expects it.

2. **NRVO (Named Return Value Optimization)**:
   - A more advanced form of RVO where the compiler optimizes the return of a **named local variable**.
   - The compiler constructs the named variable directly in the caller's memory location.

Both RVO and NRVO are forms of **copy elision**, which is allowed by the C++ standard (even if it changes the observable behavior of the program).

---

### **Why Use RVO and NRVO?**
1. **Performance Improvement**:
   - Eliminates unnecessary copy or move operations, which can be expensive for large or complex objects.

2. **Simpler Code**:
   - Allows you to write clean, intuitive code without worrying about performance penalties for returning objects by value.

3. **Encourages Value Semantics**:
   - Makes it easier to use value semantics (returning objects by value) instead of relying on pointers or references.

---

### **How RVO and NRVO Work**
When a function returns an object by value, the compiler can optimize the return process by constructing the object directly in the caller's memory location. This avoids:
- Creating a temporary object in the function.
- Copying or moving the temporary object to the caller's location.

---

### **Example: RVO**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyObject {
public:
    MyObject() {
        std::cout << "Constructor\n";
    }

    MyObject(const MyObject&) {
        std::cout << "Copy Constructor\n";
    }

    MyObject(MyObject&&) {
        std::cout << "Move Constructor\n";
    }
};

MyObject createObject() {
    return MyObject(); // RVO can eliminate the temporary object
}

int main() {
    MyObject obj = createObject();
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output (with RVO):**
```
Constructor
```

#### **Output (without RVO):**
```
Constructor
Move Constructor
```

#### **Explanation:**
- With RVO, the compiler constructs the `MyObject` directly in the memory location of `obj` in `main()`, avoiding the move constructor.
- Without RVO, a temporary object is created in `createObject()`, and then the move constructor is called to transfer it to `obj`.

---

### **Example: NRVO**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyObject {
public:
    MyObject() {
        std::cout << "Constructor\n";
    }

    MyObject(const MyObject&) {
        std::cout << "Copy Constructor\n";
    }

    MyObject(MyObject&&) {
        std::cout << "Move Constructor\n";
    }
};

MyObject createObject() {
    MyObject obj; // Named local variable
    return obj; // NRVO can eliminate the copy/move
}

int main() {
    MyObject obj = createObject();
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output (with NRVO):**
```
Constructor
```

#### **Output (without NRVO):**
```
Constructor
Move Constructor
```

#### **Explanation:**
- With NRVO, the compiler constructs `obj` directly in the memory location of `obj` in `main()`, avoiding the move constructor.
- Without NRVO, the move constructor is called to transfer the local `obj` to the caller's location.

---

### **Key Differences Between RVO and NRVO**
| **Feature**            | **RVO**                              | **NRVO**                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **What is Optimized**   | Return of a temporary object.        | Return of a named local variable.     |
| **Complexity**          | Simpler to implement.                | More complex to implement.            |
| **Guarantee**           | Mandatory in C++17 (in some cases).  | Not guaranteed by the standard.       |

---

### **C++17 and Guaranteed Copy Elision**
In C++17, **mandatory copy elision** was introduced in certain cases, making RVO effectively guaranteed. For example:
- When returning a temporary object (e.g., `return MyObject();`).
- When initializing an object with a temporary (e.g., `MyObject obj = MyObject();`).

This means that even if the copy/move constructor is deleted or private, the code will still work because no copy/move operation is performed.

---

### **Example: Guaranteed Copy Elision in C++17**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyObject {
public:
    MyObject() {
        std::cout << "Constructor\n";
    }

    MyObject(const MyObject&) = delete; // Copy constructor deleted
    MyObject(MyObject&&) = delete;      // Move constructor deleted
};

MyObject createObject() {
    return MyObject(); // Guaranteed copy elision in C++17
}

int main() {
    MyObject obj = createObject(); // No copy/move constructor called
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output:**
```
Constructor
```

#### **Explanation:**
- In C++17, the compiler is required to elide the copy/move operation when returning a temporary object.
- Even though the copy and move constructors are deleted, the code compiles and runs successfully.

---

### **When to Rely on RVO and NRVO**
1. **Return Objects by Value**:
   - Use RVO and NRVO to return objects by value without worrying about performance penalties.

2. **Avoid Premature Optimization**:
   - Write clean, intuitive code and let the compiler handle optimizations.

3. **Use C++17 or Later**:
   - Take advantage of guaranteed copy elision in C++17 to ensure optimal performance.

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Prefer Returning by Value**:
   - Return objects by value and rely on RVO/NRVO for optimization.

2. **Avoid Returning References to Local Variables**:
   - Returning references to local variables is unsafe and can lead to undefined behavior.

3. **Use Move Semantics for Large Objects**:
   - For large objects, ensure move semantics are implemented to optimize performance when RVO/NRVO cannot be applied.

---

## **Rule of Zero** 
The **Rule of Zero** is a modern C++ guideline that states:

> **"Classes should not define any custom destructors, copy/move constructors, or copy/move assignment operators. Instead, they should rely on the compiler-generated defaults and use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) types to manage resources."**

In other words, the Rule of Zero encourages you to design classes in such a way that they **do not need to manually manage resources**. Instead, resource management is delegated to member objects that already follow the Rule of Three or Rule of Five (e.g., smart pointers, containers, or other RAII types).

---

### **Why the Rule of Zero Exists**
The Rule of Zero simplifies class design and reduces the likelihood of bugs by:
1. **Avoiding Manual Resource Management**:
   - Manual resource management is error-prone and can lead to memory leaks, double deletions, or undefined behavior.
2. **Promoting RAII**:
   - RAII ensures that resources are automatically managed by the lifetimes of objects.
3. **Reducing Code Duplication**:
   - By relying on compiler-generated special member functions, you avoid writing repetitive and error-prone code.

---

### **Key Principles of the Rule of Zero**
1. **Use RAII Types**:
   - Manage resources using types like `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::vector`, or other containers that already handle resource management.

2. **Avoid Custom Destructors**:
   - If your class doesn't directly manage resources, you don't need a custom destructor.

3. **Avoid Custom Copy/Move Constructors and Assignment Operators**:
   - If your class members are RAII types, the compiler-generated copy/move constructors and assignment operators will work correctly.

4. **Leverage Compiler-Generated Functions**:
   - The compiler-generated destructor, copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, and move assignment operator are sufficient for classes that follow the Rule of Zero.

---

### **Example: Rule of Zero in Action**
Here’s an example of a class that follows the Rule of Zero by using RAII types to manage resources:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory> // for std::unique_ptr
#include <string>

class MyClass {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<std::string> data; // RAII type manages the resource
public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass(const std::string& value) : data(std::make_unique<std::string>(value)) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called\n";
    }

    // No need for custom destructor, copy/move constructors, or assignment operators

    // Accessor
    void print() const {
        if (data) {
            std::cout << *data << "\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "(null)\n";
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1("Hello");
    obj1.print();

    MyClass obj2 = std::move(obj1); // Move constructor (compiler-generated)
    obj1.print(); // obj1 is now in a valid but unspecified state
    obj2.print();

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output:**
```
Constructor called
Hello
(null)
Hello
```

#### **Explanation:**
1. The `MyClass` class uses a `std::unique_ptr` to manage a dynamically allocated `std::string`.
2. Since `std::unique_ptr` is an RAII type, it automatically handles resource cleanup.
3. The compiler-generated destructor, copy/move constructors, and assignment operators work correctly because `std::unique_ptr` follows the Rule of Five.
4. No custom destructor, copy/move constructors, or assignment operators are needed.

### **Comparison with Rule of Three and Rule of Five**
| **Rule**              | **Description**                                                                 | **When to Use**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rule of Three**     | Define a custom destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment operator.     | When managing resources manually in pre-C++11 code.                            |
| **Rule of Five**      | Add move constructor and move assignment operator to the Rule of Three.         | When managing resources manually in C++11 or later.                            |
| **Rule of Zero**      | Do not define any custom destructor, copy/move constructors, or assignment operators. | When using RAII types to manage resources (preferred in modern C++).           |

---

### **Advantages of the Rule of Zero**
1. **Simplicity**:
   - Classes are easier to write, read, and maintain.
2. **Safety**:
   - Reduces the risk of resource management errors (e.g., memory leaks, double deletions).
3. **Performance**:
   - Compiler-generated functions are often more efficient than hand-written ones.
4. **Consistency**:
   - Encourages the use of RAII types, which are well-tested and reliable.

---

### **When to Use the Rule of Zero**
1. **Modern C++ Code**:
   - Use the Rule of Zero in C++11 or later, where RAII types like smart pointers and containers are widely available.

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Use RAII types to manage resources instead of writing custom destructors, copy/move constructors, or assignment operators.

3. **Avoiding Boilerplate Code**:
   - Use the Rule of Zero to avoid writing repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.

---

### **Example: Rule of Zero with Multiple Resources**
Here’s an example of a class that manages multiple resources using RAII types:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory> // for std::unique_ptr
#include <vector> // for std::vector

class ResourceHolder {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<int[]> data; // RAII type for dynamic array
    std::vector<std::string> strings; // RAII type for strings
public:
    // Constructor
    ResourceHolder(size_t size, const std::string& str)
        : data(std::make_unique<int[]>(size)), strings(size, str) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called\n";
    }

    // No need for custom destructor, copy/move constructors, or assignment operators

    // Accessor
    void print() const {
        std::cout << "Data: " << data[0] << "\n";
        std::cout << "Strings: " << strings[0] << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    ResourceHolder obj1(10, "Hello");
    obj1.print();

    ResourceHolder obj2 = std::move(obj1); // Move constructor (compiler-generated)
    obj2.print();

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output:**
```
Constructor called
Data: 0
Strings: Hello
Data: 0
Strings: Hello
```

#### **Explanation:**
1. The `ResourceHolder` class uses `std::unique_ptr` and `std::vector` to manage resources.
2. The compiler-generated special member functions work correctly because the member objects are RAII types.
3. No custom destructor, copy/move constructors, or assignment operators are needed.
