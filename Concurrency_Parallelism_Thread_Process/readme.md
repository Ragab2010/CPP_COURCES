/*---->C++ Concurrency<----
Concurrency vs. Parallelism:
Concurrency and parallelism are two related computer science concepts in programming and system/code design. 
    Both deal with executing multiple tasks, but they differ in how those tasks are managed and executed.    
    
    -Concurrency:
    Analogy: Imagine a single chef (one CPU core) preparing multiple dishes. 
        The chef switches between chopping vegetables for one dish, stirring a pot for another, 
            and checking the oven for a third. The tasks overlap in time, but only 
            one is actively being worked on at any given moment.
            --The chef prioritizes quick responses to customer orders, even if it means switching between tasks frequently.
            -- if we want improve Determinism, The system (chef) is deterministic because the timing of each task is predictable and bounded.

        --Concurrency is about dealing with multiple tasks at the same time , by executing them simultaneously. 
        --The tasks overlap in time, but only one is actively being worked on at any given moment.
            Example: A single-core CPU running multiple threads by rapidly switching between them (time-slicing).
        --Concurrency is about task management. It allows a program to make progress on multiple things 
            by interleaving their execution, even on a single thread or core.
        --Use Case: Concurrency is useful for improving responsiveness and resource utilization, 
            especially in I/O-bound tasks (e.g., handling multiple network requests or user inputs).

    -Parallelism:
    Analogy: Now imagine multiple chefs (multiple CPU cores) working on different dishes at once. 
    One chef chops vegetables, another stirs the pot, and a third bakes—all happening at the exact same time.

    --Parallelism is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously, by leveraging multiple processors or cores.
    -- all The tasks happening at the exact same time.
        Example: A multi-core CPU running multiple threads in parallel, with each core executing a separate thread.
    --Parallelism is about speed and throughput. It’s true multitasking, where independent tasks run concurrently
             and simultaneously.
    --Use Case: Parallelism is useful for improving performance in CPU-bound tasks 
        (e.g., matrix multiplication, rendering, or data processing).

Real-World Analogy :Responsiveness VS Determinism
    --Responsiveness: Think of a fast-food restaurant where the goal is to serve customers as quickly as possible, even if it means juggling multiple orders at once.
    --Determinism: Think of a high-end restaurant where each course of a meal is served at a precise time, ensuring a consistent and predictable dining experience.

Concurrency vs. Parallelism: The Difference
    --Concurrency is a programming model—a way to structure your code to handle multiple tasks, whether they run at the same time or not.
    --Parallelism is an execution model—it’s about actually running tasks simultaneously, which requires hardware support (e.g., multiple cores).

Concurrency Enables Parallelism:
    --Concurrency provides the structure and design patterns (e.g., threads, tasks, or coroutines) that make parallelism possible.
    --For example, a concurrent program can be executed in parallel if the hardware supports it (e.g., multiple cores).

Parallelism Requires Concurrency:
    --To achieve parallelism, you need a concurrent design that allows tasks to be divided and executed independently.

Concurrency Without Parallelism:
    --Concurrency can exist without parallelism. For example, a single-core CPU can run a concurrent program by interleaving tasks, even though only one task is executed at a time.

Parallelism Without Concurrency:
    --Parallelism without concurrency is rare. Typically, parallelism relies on concurrent structures (e.g., threads or processes) to divide and execute tasks simultaneously.

Process vs Thread:---> dealing with multitasking and concurrent execution.

Analogy:Processes and Threads in the Chef Example
    Processes:
        --A process is like a separate kitchen with its own resources (e.g., stove, oven, utensils) and a dedicated chef.
        --Each kitchen operates independently and prepares a single dish from start to finish.
        --Processes do not share resources directly; they are isolated from each other.

    Threads:
        --A thread is like a single chef in a kitchen who can work on multiple tasks (e.g., chopping vegetables, boiling pasta, grilling meat) concurrently.
        --All threads share the same resources (e.g., stove, oven, utensils) within the same kitchen.
        --Threads are lightweight and can switch between tasks quickly.

Process:
    --A process is an instance of a running program. It has its own memory space, resources, and state.
Key Characteristics:
    ---Isolation: Each process operates independently and is isolated from other processes.
    ---Memory: A process has its own address space (code, data, heap, stack).
    ---Overhead: Processes are heavyweight because they require more resources (memory, CPU) to create and manage.
    ---Communication: Inter-process communication (IPC) is required for processes to share data (e.g., pipes, sockets, shared memory).
    ---Use Case: Processes are used when tasks need strong isolation and security (e.g., running separate applications).

Thread:
    --Definition: A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within a single process and share the same memory space.

Key Characteristics:
    --Shared Memory: Threads within the same process share the same address space and resources.
    --Lightweight: Threads are faster to create and manage compared to processes.
    --Communication: Threads can communicate directly through shared memory, making data sharing easier but requiring synchronization (e.g., mutexes, semaphores).
    --Concurrency: Threads enable concurrent execution within a process.
    --Use Case: Threads are used for tasks that require high performance and shared data (e.g., parallel computations, handling multiple connections in a server).

| Definition          | An independent program in execution.      | A lightweight unit of execution within a process. |
| Memory Space        | Has its own isolated virtual memory space.| Shares the process’s memory space (heap, data, text). |
| Stack               | Has one stack (for a single-threaded process). | Each thread has its own private stack.  |
| Resource Ownership  | Owns resources (memory, file handles, etc.). | Shares resources with other threads in the process. |
| Creation Overhead   | Higher (requires duplicating memory, resources). | Lower (just allocates a stack and registers). |
| Communication       | Inter-process communication (IPC) needed (e.g., pipes, sockets). | Direct memory access (shared variables), faster. |
| Isolation           | Fully isolated from other processes.     | Not isolated—shares memory with other threads. |
| Execution           | Runs independently, scheduled by OS.     | Runs within a process, scheduled by OS or thread library. |
| Example in C++      | Running two `main()` programs separately.| Using `std::thread` within one program. |
| Synchronization     | Not needed unless IPC is used.           | Often requires mutexes, locks (e.g., `std::mutex`). |
| Termination         | Kills all its threads when it ends.      | Can end independently, but process continues unless all threads stop. |
| Context Switching   | Slower (switching entire memory space).  | Faster (same address space, just stack/registers). |

Relationship Between Processes and Threads
Threads Exist Within Processes:
    --A process can have one or more threads. The first thread is called the main thread.
    --Threads share the process's resources (memory, files, etc.) but have their own stack and registers.

Processes Provide Isolation, Threads Provide Concurrency:
    --Processes are isolated from each other, providing security and stability.
    --Threads enable concurrent execution within a process, improving performance and responsiveness.

Communication and Synchronization:
    --Processes: Require IPC mechanisms (e.g., pipes, sockets) to communicate, which is slower and more complex.
    --Threads: Can communicate directly through shared memory, but synchronization is required to avoid race conditions.

Resource Usage:
    --Processes: Consume more resources (memory, CPU) because each process has its own address space.
    --Threads: Consume fewer resources because they share the same address space.

how can how  A “hardware thread”  the number of independent execution contexts a CPU 
    that can handle at once. This is tied to the CPU’s architectur?
    --std::cout << "Hardware concurrency: " << std::thread::hardware_concurrency() << "\n";
    --run at bash : nproc

std::thread:
    --std::thread is a class in the C++ Standard Library that represents a single thread of execution.
    --Purpose: To execute a function or callable object (like a lambda or functor) in a separate thread.
    --Key Idea: Each std::thread object corresponds to an OS thread, and the OS schedules it to run on available hardware threads.
    --The constructor of the thread class is a variadic template, meaning it can accept any number of arguments.
