## What is a Semaphore?

A **semaphore** is a synchronization primitive that manages access to shared resources or coordinates threads by maintaining a counter. The counter represents the number of available "permits" (or resources) that threads can acquire or release. When a thread acquires a permit, the counter decrements; when it releases a permit, the counter increments. If no permits are available, threads block until one becomes available.

- **Header**: `<semaphore>` (C++20 and later)
- **Purpose**:
  - Limit concurrent access to a fixed number of resources (e.g., database connections).
  - Signal events between threads (e.g., producer-consumer scenarios).

---

## Key Concepts and Analogy

**Core Idea**: Think of a semaphore as a ticket booth at a parking lot with limited spaces. Threads are like cars needing a ticket (permit) to enter. If no tickets are available, cars wait in line. When a car leaves, it returns the ticket, allowing another car to enter.

**Example** (Semaphore with 2 permits):
```
[Semaphore: counter = 2]
T1: acquire() â†’ [Semaphore: counter = 1]  // T1 takes a permit
T2: acquire() â†’ [Semaphore: counter = 0]  // T2 takes the last permit
T3: acquire() â†’ [Blocked, waiting]        // T3 waits for a permit
T1: release() â†’ [Semaphore: counter = 1]  // T1 returns a permit, T3 unblocks
T3: acquire() â†’ [Semaphore: counter = 0]  // T3 takes the permit
```

## Types of Semaphores

1. **Counting Semaphore** (`std::counting_semaphore<N>`):
   - Maintains a non-negative counter, allowing up to `N` threads to acquire permits concurrently.
   - **Use Case**: Limiting access to a fixed resource pool (e.g., 5 database connections).
2. **Binary Semaphore** (`std::binary_semaphore`):
   - A special case of `std::counting_semaphore<1>`, with a counter of 0 or 1.
   - **Use Case**: Signaling between threads or acting as a lightweight mutex.

## Key Methods

| Method                  | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `acquire()`             | Blocks until the counter is > 0, then decrements it.                        |
| `release(n = 1)`        | Increments the counter by `n`, potentially unblocking waiting threads.      |
| `try_acquire()`         | Attempts to decrement the counter without blocking; returns `false` if 0.   |
| `try_acquire_for(duration)` | Tries to acquire a permit for a specified duration; returns `false` if timed out. |
| `try_acquire_until(time_point)` | Tries to acquire a permit until a specific time; returns `false` if timed out. |
| `max()`                 | Returns the maximum counter value (`N`) for the semaphore.                  |

## How std::counting_semaphore Works

`std::counting_semaphore<N>` is a template class where `N` is the maximum counter value. Here's how it operates:

- **Constructor**: `std::counting_semaphore<N>(ptrdiff_t initial_count)` initializes the counter.
- **Thread Safety**: Operations are atomic, ensuring safe concurrent access.
- **Mechanics**:
  - `acquire()`: Decrements the counter; blocks if the counter is 0.
  - `release(n)`: Increments the counter by `n`, unblocking waiting threads if needed.
  - `try_acquire*`: Non-blocking attempts to acquire a permit with optional timeout.

**Example Implementation** (Simplified for clarity):
```cpp
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <stdexcept>

template <ptrdiff_t LeastMaxValue>
class counting_semaphore {
private:
    ptrdiff_t counter; // Current count of permits
    ptrdiff_t max_count; // Maximum allowed count
    std::mutex mutex; // Protects counter
    std::condition_variable cv; // For blocking/unblocking threads

public:
    explicit counting_semaphore(ptrdiff_t desired)
        : counter(desired), max_count(LeastMaxValue) {
        if (desired < 0 || desired > LeastMaxValue) {
            throw std::logic_error("Semaphore count out of range");
        }
    }

    counting_semaphore(const counting_semaphore&) = delete;
    counting_semaphore& operator=(const counting_semaphore&) = delete;

    void acquire() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        cv.wait(lock, [this] { return counter > 0; });
        --counter;
    }

    bool try_acquire() noexcept {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        if (counter == 0) return false;
        --counter;
        return true;
    }

    void release(ptrdiff_t update = 1) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        if (update < 0 || counter + update > max_count) {
            throw std::logic_error("Semaphore release exceeds max_count");
        }
        counter += update;
        lock.unlock();
        cv.notify_one();
    }
};
```

## Semaphore vs. Other Primitives

| Primitive               | Key Features                                      | When to Use                                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Mutex** (`std::mutex`) | Mutual exclusion (1 thread at a time).           | Exclusive resource access.                    |
| **Semaphore** (`std::counting_semaphore`) | Multiple threads (counting) or signaling.       | Resource pools or producer-consumer signaling. |
| **Condition Variable** (`std::condition_variable`) | Flexible signaling with mutex.                 | Complex thread coordination.                  |
| **Latch** (`std::latch`) | One-time countdown to zero.                     | One-off synchronization.                      |
| **Barrier** (`std::barrier`) | All threads wait for each other.               | Group synchronization.                        |
| **Atomic** (`std::atomic`) | Lock-free for simple data.                     | High-performance, simple data operations.      |

## Example Implementations

### 1. Limiting Resource Access (Counting Semaphore)

**Scenario**: Limit access to 3 database connections among 5 threads.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <semaphore>
#include <chrono>

void worker(std::counting_semaphore<3>& sem, int id) {
    sem.acquire(); // Acquire a permit (max 3)
    std::cout << "Worker " << id << " acquired resource\n";
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(200)); // Simulate work
    std::cout << "Worker " << id << " releasing resource\n";
    sem.release(); // Release the permit
}

int main() {
    std::counting_semaphore<3> sem(3); // 3 permits
    std::thread threads[5];
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        threads[i] = std::thread(worker, std::ref(sem), i + 1);
    }
    for (auto& t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output** (order may vary):
```
Worker 1 acquired resource
Worker 2 acquired resource
Worker 3 acquired resource
Worker 1 releasing resource
Worker 4 acquired resource
Worker 2 releasing resource
Worker 5 acquired resource
Worker 3 releasing resource
Worker 4 releasing resource
Worker 5 releasing resource
```

**Explanation**: Only 3 threads can acquire permits at a time. Others wait until a permit is released.

### 2. Signaling Between Threads (Binary Semaphore)

**Scenario**: A producer signals a consumer to proceed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <semaphore>

void producer(std::binary_semaphore& sem) {
    std::cout << "Producer preparing data\n";
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    std::cout << "Producer signaling\n";
    sem.release(); // Signal consumer
}

void consumer(std::binary_semaphore& sem) {
    std::cout << "Consumer waiting\n";
    sem.acquire(); // Wait for signal
    std::cout << "Consumer processing data\n";
}

int main() {
    std::binary_semaphore sem(0); // Start with 0 permits
    std::thread t1(producer, std::ref(sem));
    std::thread t2(consumer, std::ref(sem));
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Consumer waiting
Producer preparing data
Producer signaling
Consumer processing data
```

**Explanation**: The consumer waits for the producer's signal (permit release).

### 3. Try Acquire with Timeout (Duration)

**Scenario**: A thread tries to acquire a permit with a 50ms timeout.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <semaphore>
#include <chrono>

void worker(std::counting_semaphore<1>& sem, int id) {
    if (sem.try_acquire_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50))) {
        std::cout << "Worker " << id << " got resource\n";
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
        sem.release();
    } else {
        std::cout << "Worker " << id << " timed out\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::counting_semaphore<1> sem(1); // 1 permit
    std::thread t1(worker, std::ref(sem), 1);
    std::thread t2(worker, std::ref(sem), 2);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output** (order may vary):
```
Worker 1 got resource
Worker 2 timed out
```

**Explanation**: Worker 2 times out because Worker 1 holds the only permit.

### 4. Try Acquire with Timeout (Time Point)

**Scenario**: A thread tries to acquire a permit until a specific time point.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <semaphore>
#include <chrono>

void worker(std::counting_semaphore<1>& sem, int id) {
    auto deadline = std::chrono::steady_clock::now() + std::chrono::milliseconds(50);
    if (sem.try_acquire_until(deadline)) {
        std::cout << "Worker " << id << " got resource\n";
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
        sem.release();
    } else {
        std::cout << "Worker " << id << " timed out\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::counting_semaphore<1> sem(1); // 1 permit
    std::thread t1(worker, std::ref(sem), 1);
    std::thread t2(worker, std::ref(sem), 2);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output** (order may vary):
```
Worker 1 got resource
Worker 2 timed out
```

**Explanation**: Similar to the duration-based timeout, Worker 2 fails to acquire a permit before the deadline.

## Use Cases

- **Thread Pools**: Control the number of concurrent tasks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Restrict the number of threads accessing a resource per time unit.
- **Resource Pools**: Manage access to a fixed number of resources (e.g., database connections).
- **Producer-Consumer**: Coordinate data production and consumption between threads.

## FAQ

**Q: How is a semaphore different from a mutex?**  
A: A mutex ensures mutual exclusion (one thread at a time), while a semaphore can allow multiple threads (counting semaphore) or act as a signal (binary semaphore).

**Q: When should I use a binary semaphore instead of a mutex?**  
A: Use a binary semaphore for signaling between threads (e.g., producer-consumer). Use a mutex for protecting shared resources requiring exclusive access.

**Q: Can I use semaphores in pre-C++20 code?**  
A: No, `std::counting_semaphore` and `std::binary_semaphore` are C++20 features. For older code, use libraries like Boost or implement custom semaphores.

**Q: Are semaphores thread-safe?**  
A: Yes, `std::counting_semaphore` operations are atomic, ensuring safe concurrent access.
